## Overview

This app created training dataset for SmartTool from labeled project. All classes in the input project have to be `Bitmaps`. Please, use app [Rasterize objects on images](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/rasterize-objects-on-images) to raster all objects and prepare correct object masks. It is crucial for this app.  

All classes will be converted to a single class, then instances crop will be performed and then positive/negative points will be randomly generated. 

**Note**: Customization of SmartTool is available only in Enterprise Edition (EE).

## How To Run

### Step 1: Run from context menu of project

Go to "Context Menu" of project with images -> "Run App" -> "Training data" -> "Create Trainset for SmartTool"
